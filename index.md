## Overview

Decentralized Application (D-App) security standards and best practices guide for securing the blockchain. The guide provides information about the most major security risks for decentralized applications (D-Apps) and blockchain smart contracts including Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the unique challenges involved and how to overcome them.

AppSec: ->What i learned from Crypto 
* Same attacks in a new paradigm 
* Trust can be transitive 
* Trust can not be transitive 
* Security by economics is a skill set 
* Immutable applications are a thing 
* Security is a evolutionary process 
* Community is critical


## Purpose

OWASP BlockChain AppSec Security Standard wants to raise awareness about the consequences of the most common blockchain security vulnerabilities and provide basic techniques to identify and protect against them.

## Getting Involved

You do not have to be a security expert or a programmer to contribute. Contact the project leader(s) to get involved. We welcome any suggestions and comments. Possible ways to contribute:

 * We are actively looking for organizations and individuals who understand blockchain security challenges.
 * Individuals and organizations contributing to the project will be listed on the acknowledgments page.

## Non-fungible Tokens (NFTS)

* **[DATA1:2023 - Injection Attacks][DATA1:2023]**

  Unauthorized individuals exploiting vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or commands that can compromise data integrity and confidentiality. [Continue reading][DATA1:2023].

## Wallets
