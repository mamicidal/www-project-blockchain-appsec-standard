## Overview

The guide focuses on blockchain, decentralized applications (D-Apps), NFTs, cryptocurrency, and related infrastructure providing best practices, known risks and mitigations and other information related to the unique challenges of understanding blockchain.

## Getting Involved

You do not have to be a security expert or a programmer to contribute. Contact the project leader(s) to get involved. We welcome any suggestions and comments. Possible ways to contribute:

 * We are actively looking for organizations and individuals who understand blockchain security challenges.
 * Individuals and organizations contributing to the project will be listed on the acknowledgments page.

## Blockchain vs Web3

Blockchain is the technological backbone of Web3 and as a fundamental technology, like a database, allows for new types of systems in Web3. Web3, built from blockchain, is a tokenization system that is unique to the owner that can provide absolute, transparent authority.  

An example of such a system in Web3, built from the foundation of blockchain is as follows:

A user logs in to a website for the first time using their on-chain wallet address with a single signature passwords, user accounts, all new interaction on the web. The worst thing to ever happen to blockchain is cryptocurrency. 

## Non-fungible Tokens (NFTS)
