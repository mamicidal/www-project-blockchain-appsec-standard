## Overview

The guide focuses on blockchain, decentralized applications (D-Apps), NFTs, cryptocurrency, and related infrastructure providing best practices, known risks and mitigations and other information related to the unique challenges of understanding blockchain.

AppSec: ->What i learned from Crypto 
* Same attacks in a new paradigm 
* Trust can be transitive 
* Trust can not be transitive 
* Security by economics is a skill set 
* Immutable applications are a thing 
* Security is a evolutionary process 
* Community is critical


## Purpose

OWASP BlockChain AppSec Security Standard wants to raise awareness about the consequences of the most common blockchain security vulnerabilities and provide basic techniques to identify and protect against them.
